Most of these Landlab tutorials can either be read as text files or run as interactive IPython notebooks (recommended!).

To run the IPython notebook tutorials locally, you can copy this [landlab/tutorials](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials) repo to your local working environment (use the ``download ZIP`` button or fork/clone, whichever is most familiar to you).

Alternatively, you can also access each notebook online from [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials) and download an individual notebook (navigate to the specific IPython notebook you want, open it, and click the download button that appears in the upper right).

After downloading/cloning, navigate into your new directory (or to the directory containing your new download) from the command line in your terminal.

Use the command ``$ ipython notebook`` to launch the IPython notebook viewer (it will open locally in your browser). Then navigate to the ``.ipynb`` tutorial you want to run and click to open it.

To run the code in the notebook, place your cursor in a code cell, hold down ``shift``, and press ``enter``. The order in which you run the cells matters. You can even experiment with typing your own code into the cell and running that.

Here is a short IPython notebook tutorial along with a screencast (the tutorial uses an example with statistics, but you can substitute Landlab!): http://www.randalolson.com/2012/05/12/a-short-demo-on-how-to-use-ipython-notebook-as-a-research-notebook/
