    "## Overview\n",
    "A Landlab component is implemented as a Python `class`. Although every Landlab component is unique in some respects, to be a component, a class must have at least the following standard ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The class must inherit the base class `Component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The class must include a set of standard variables defined in the header (i.e., before the `__init__` method), which describe the data arrays that the component uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The class must have an `__init__` method defined, with a semi-standardized parameter list described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The class must provide a function that does performs the component's \"action\", typically named `run_one_step()` and this function's parameter list must follow the convention described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class definition and header\n",
    "\n",
    "A Landlab component is a class that inherits from `Component`. The name of the class should be in CamelCase, and should make sense when used in the sentence: \"A *(component-name)* is a...\". The class definition should be followed by a docstring. The docstring should include a list of parameters for the `__init__` method."

    "## The initialization method (`__init__`)\n",
    "Every Landlab component should have an `__init__` method. The parameter signature should start with a `ModelGrid` object as the first parameter, and list `**kwds` as the last parameter. In between are component-specific parameters. In our example, the parameters for the kinematic wave model include: precipiation rate, precipitation duration, infiltration rate, and roughness coefficient (Manning's n). (The final `**kwds` is what allows you to pass in a dictionary of input parameters, so make sure it's there).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things a component `__init__` method common does are (1) store the component's parameters as class attributes, and (2) create the necessary fields. When creating grid fields, it is important to first check to see whether a field with the same name (and mapping) already exists. For example, a driver or another component might have already created `topographic__elevation` when our kinematic wave component is initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of different approaches to creating and working with fields. In the example below, we use the straightforward approach of creating them one at a time by name. We keep a reference to each field as a variable; for example, `self.elev` refers to the grid field `topographic_elevation`. It is also possible to automate the process by looping over all names in, say, `_var_mapping`, checking each to see whether it exists, and creating it if not. The `Component` method `initialize_output_fields()` may help with this, which will already be a member of your component because it inherits from `Component`."
